A gentle introduction to the R code used in this
practical workshop is provided in "Spatial microsimulation in R: a beginner's guide to iterative proportional fitting (IPF)",
available from [rpubs.com/RobinLovelace/5089](http://rpubs.com/RobinLovelace/5089).

For a more advanced R code for spatial microsimulation, please see the GitHub repository
