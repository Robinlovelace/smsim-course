\chapter{Preface}

% The trigger for this book's creation was a two day course, An
% Introduction to Spatial Microsimulation with R, held at the University
% of Leeds in the spring of 2014. Based on the high demand before the course
% and feedback from participants taking part, it seemed there was a
% definite need for more practical teaching material on spatial microsimulation
% than was available at the time: many people had read the literature and had
% a good idea about the problem that they wanted to harness the method to solve.
% Yet the majority were dissatisfied with the \emph{practical} content of existing
% work, or lack thereof.
% 
% This book is for all those struggling to find material clearly and succinctly
% explaining how to implement spatial microsimulation on their own
% datasets.
% 
% The underlying motivations for this work go much deeper and are best understood with
% reference to my own experience of trying to learn spatial microsimulation. I, like many PhD students
% and researchers, was tasked with implementing the method when it was almost completely new to me.
% I had barely heard of the method, let alone understood the methodology.
% The first stage was to read up on what spatial microsimulation
% actually was: in this area I was fortunate enough to have good guidance from my
% supervisor Dimitris Ballas, who pointed me towards an accessible introduction to
% spatial microsimulation commissioned by the Joseph Roundtree Foundation \citep{Ballas2005b}.
% Without this text, I'd have been even more bewildered; overcoming this
% bewilderment is a central aim of this course. It will not demonstrate how,
% exactly, to apply the method to your own datasets, but it will provide strong
% foundations that should enable the method to be applied to almost any combination
% of individual and aggregate level datasets, provided suitable shared variables between the two.
% As emphasised in the closing chapter of the book, it is the responsibility of
% the researcher to ensure that the method is applied in a rigorous and ethical way:
% this cannot be taught, although the extensive CakeMap example will demonstrate how
% the method can be used in rather absurd ways.
% 
% In addition to good guidance towards introductory reading, another major benefit
% I had was having Malcolm Campbell as my predecessor. Malcolm provided a huge amount of
% support during the early phase of my PhD and shared the entirety of the R code he developed
% to perform spatial microsimulation on his Scottish health data.
% Not only was the code invaluable to my efforts to build a spatial microsimulation model in
% R (some of the code in the book is probably his at some level), his example of collaboration
% and code sharing was truly inspirational. Thus this book owes 
% much to Malcolm as to anyone. 
% The free distribution of its underlying code
% and example data is largely due to his
% generosity in sharing code and enthusiasm of teaching tricky statistical techniques.

\chapter{Introduction}

Spatial microsimulation is shrouded by an unnecessary mystery, and this is worsened
by much of the literature on the subject. Most academic papers and even some textbooks
about spatial microsimulation lack reproducible examples. In today's age of fast
Internet connections, open access datasets and free software,
things need not be this way. One could argue that the lack of
reproducibility in spatial microsimulation is damaging to the growth
and credibility of the field.

To those doubting the value of this practical approach, I ask the following
questions: If only a small community of researchers hold the majority of the
code needed to perform spatial microsimulation, how can the technique spread
rapidly to other applications? If every PhD student undertaking spatial
microsimulation must start from scratch, how are the methods going to be
refined and improved in a systematic fashion? Most importantly, if the results
of most spatial microsimulation research is not reproducible --- as is currently
the case --- how can we trust them?

This final point is critical not only to spatial microsimulation but the
disciplines of which it is part. Reproducibility is a prerequisite of
falsifiability --- if the method
underlying a result cannot be replicated by others, how can the finding
possibly be falsified? Moreover, the argument continues, any knowledge or
theory can only claim to enter the realm of `science' if it cannot be falsified.
Because it is impossible to prove any proposition in every and all cases, the
only reliable test we can apply is whether or not it can be \emph{disproved}:
falsified via a contradictory finding. This is how scientific progress is made
\citep{Popper1959}. By writing non-reproducible research, researchers may
inadvertently damage the disciplines in which they work. %. how???

Despite and because of these philosophical antecedents, the course is
unashamedly practical. The aim is simple: to provide an accessible yet
deep foundation in spatial microsimulation. This involves both
\emph{understanding} and \emph{implementation} of the technique.
Following the `learning by doing' ethic, the former can best be
attained through the latter: spatial microsimulation need not be an abstract
process that one simply reads about. It can be practical tool used by anyone
with the know-how. As \citet[xxii]{kabacoff2011r} put it regarding R, ``the best
way to learn is to experiment'' and the same applies to spatial microsimulation.


Software decisions have a major impact on the model's flexibility, efficiency,
reproducibility and
ease of coding. \citet[p.~153]{Holm1987} observed that ``little attention is
paid to the choice of programming language used.''
This appears to be as true now as it was then: software is rarely discussed in
spatial microsimulation papers. 
In my own spatial microsimulation research, a conscious decision was made early
on to use R, with impacts on model features, analysis
and even design. It is thus worth understanding the tool a little before we
begin to use it. The theory is discussed in \cref{s:theory}

% \subsection{Why R?}
The world is awash with computer programming languages and many of these
are general purpose and `Turing complete', meaning they could, with sufficient
effort, perform spatial microsimulation. So why would one chose R?
The most important criteria of evaluation include flexibility,
speed of processing and, most importantly, ease and speed of writing code.
R excels in each of these areas, especially the final one: it
is possible to say a lot in R in few lines of code. Further
are provided by \citet{Matloff-R}:

\begin{itemize}
\item ``a public-domain implementation of the widely-regarded S statistical
language; R/S is the de facto standard among professional statisticians
\item comparable, and often superior, in power to commercial products in most
senses
\item available for Windows, Macs, Linux
\item in addition to enabling statistical operations, it's a general programming
language, so that you can
automate your analyses and create new functions
\item object-oriented and functional programming structure
\item your data sets are saved between sessions, so you don't have to reload
each time
\item open-software nature means it’s easy to get help from the user
community''
\end{itemize}
% Add in disadvantages here.

\section{Learning the R language}

Having learned a little about \emph{why} R is a good tool for the job,
it is time to think about \emph{how} R should be used. The most
useful advice I received on the subject is to think of R not as a
series of isolated commands, but as an interconnected \emph{language},
in the fullest sense of the word. R is not only a system by which
instructions can be sent to a computer to process data; R provides a way
of expressing oneself and explaining ideas to other human beings.
Critical to its role as a language is R's unique \emph{syntax}, which allows it
to express relatively complex expressions efficently, with a small number of
keystrokes.

The unusually concise nature of R code
is not an accident. It was planned to be this way from the
outset by its instigators, Robert Gentleman and Ross Ihaka, who thought
carefully about syntax from the outset:
``the syntax of a language is important
because it determines
the way that users of the language express themselves'' \citep[p.~300]{Ihaka2014}.
