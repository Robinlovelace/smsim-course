Spatial microsimulation is a large and complex topic, with over 30 years of
history. It is therefore impossible to provide a comprehensive introduction
to the topic in a single 1.5 day course.

There are opportunities for further study before and after undertaking the
course, however. For a broader introduction to the technique of spatial
microsimulation in technical terms, readers are directed towards
[Lovelace and Ballas
(2013)](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0198971513000240).
This is an open access paper so the full version of it is available to anyone.
Another useful resource describing the methods available for
spatial microsimulation
is by [Smith et al. (2009)](http://core.kmi.open.ac.uk/download/pdf/6321549.pdf).

For a more general introduction to spatial microsimulation,
[Birkin and Clarke
(2009)](http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-90-481-8930-4_9) provide
a clear overview of the most important developments in the field.

There are plans to use the teaching materials developed for this course as the
basis of a practical text book on the subject, so watch this space!
