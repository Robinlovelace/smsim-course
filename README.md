An introduction to spatial microsimulation using R
============

This `smsim-course` repository is the online home of teaching materials dedicated to a statistical technique known as spatial microsimulation.
The course was taught in May 2014 in Leeds. These materials have since been
superceded by an updated set of course notes that use the new
[ipfp](http://cran.us.r-project.org/web/packages/ipfp/) package.

The updated course repository is also on GitHub: https://github.com/Robinlovelace/spatial-microsim-book
