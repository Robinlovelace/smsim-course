An introduction to spatial microsimulation using R
============

This `smsim-course` repository is the online home of teaching materials dedicated to a statistical technique known as spatial microsimulation.

The [website of the course](http://www.robinlovelace.net/smsim-course),
which has been designed to aid face-to-face teach, but which may be of use to distance learners,
offer more details about this repository and the course itself. Overall, the aim is to provide a solid introduction to
spatial microsimulation not only in theoretical terms but with practical examples that can be replicated at home.
The practical nature of the course should allow participants to perform spatial microsimulation on their
own datasets, for real-world applications.

It is hoped that by making example code and data available here on GitHub, the course will have maximum benefit worldwide, even for those unable to attend the course in person. See the Leeds [online store](http://store.leeds.ac.uk/browse/extra_info.asp?compid=1&modid=2&catid=47&prodid=388) for more details and watch this space as the project grows.
