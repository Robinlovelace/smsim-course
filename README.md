An introduction to spatial microsimulation using R
============

This `smsim-course` repository is the online home of teaching materials dedicated to a statistical technique known as spatial microsimulation.
It is hoped that by making example code and data available here on GitHub, the course will have maximum benefit worldwide, even for those unable to attend the course in person. See the Leeds [online store](http://store.leeds.ac.uk/browse/extra_info.asp?compid=1&modid=2&catid=47&prodid=388) for more details and watch this space as the project grows.
