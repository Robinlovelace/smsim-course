# Agenda

The agenda for the 1.5 day spatial microsimulation course
(8th - 9th May 2014, University of Leeds' School of Geography)
is described on the course [booking page](http://store.leeds.ac.uk/browse/extra_info.asp?compid=1&modid=2&deptid=9&catid=47&prodid=388) in the "More info" tab.

To reiterate and expand on this information, the agenda is as follows.

## Day 1: Introduction to spatial microsimulation and R

- Introduction to Spatial Microsimulation: theory and applications
 - What is spatial microsimulation
 - What can it do: current and potential applications

**Lunch**

- R: a giant general purpose statistical calculator
 - Basic statistical procedures in R relevant to spatial microsimulation
 - An introduction to geographical data in R
 - Modelling in R
- The internals of ‘population synthesis’, reweighting and input/outputs data
- Integerisation: from fractional weights to whole samples

## Day 2: Applications

- Processing and analysis of spatial microdata
- Extensions to the basic model
 - As an input into agent based models
 - Adding estimated home (and work) locations
 - Grouping individuals into household units
- Tailoring the code for your needs
