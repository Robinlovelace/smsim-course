# Agenda

The agenda for the 1.5 day spatial microsimulation course
(8th - 9th May 2014, University of Leeds' School of Geography)
is described on the course [booking page](http://store.leeds.ac.uk/browse/extra_info.asp?compid=1&modid=2&deptid=9&catid=47&prodid=388) in the "More info" tab.

To reiterate and expand on this information, the agenda is as follows.

## Day 1: Introduction to spatial microsimulation and R

**9:15 – 9:30 a.m. Welcome/Refreshments**

- 9:30 – 11:00 Introduction to Spatial Microsimulation: theory and applications
 - What is spatial microsimulation
 - What can it do: current and potential applications
 - Worked example with pen and paper

**11:00 – 11.15 a.m. Tea/Coffee**

- 11:15 - 1:00 R: a giant general purpose statistical calculator
 - Loading the input data
 (filter the dataset beforehand with R)
 - Proportional fitting in R

**1:00 - 1:30 p.m. Lunch**

<!--- Basic statistical procedures in R relevant to spatial microsimulation-->
<!--- An introduction to geographical data in R-->
- 1:30 - 4:30 A worked example
 - Loading the data (without modifying the source)
 - Preparing the input data
 - Model checking

<!--[>> - Modelling in R<]-->
<!--[>> - The internals of ‘population synthesis’, reweighting and input/outputs data<]-->
<!--[>> - Integerisation: from fractional weights to whole samples<]-->

> ## Day 2: Applications

**9:15 – 9:30 Refreshments**

- 9:30 – 11:00 Processing and analysis of spatial microdata

**11:00 -11:15 a.m. Tea/Coffee** 

- 11:15 - 12:30 Extensions to the basic model
 - As an input into agent based models
 <!--- Adding estimated home (and work) locations-->
 <!--- Grouping individuals into household units-->
- 12:30 - 1:30 Tailoring the code for your needs
