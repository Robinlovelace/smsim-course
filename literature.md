Here are links to some of the core texts in spatial microsimulation and R.
These are by no means comprehensive, but should provide useful starting points for an introduction to spatial microsimulation
and a little on its history and applications.

# Background reading

- These references are available for free online. It is recommended that
course participants acquaint themselves with the basics of spatial microsimulation before the course:

- Ballas, D., Dorling, D., Thomas, B., Rossiter, D., 2005. Geography matters: simulating the local impacts of national social policies. [Joseph Roundtree Foundation](http://www.jrf.org.uk/sites/files/jrf/1859352669.pdf).


- Lovelace, R., 2013. Supplementary Information: A user manual for the integerisation of IPF weights using R 1–18. ([Linked to TRS paper](http://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/77037/7/lovelacesupplement-3.pdf)).

# R

- To get to grips with R, users are recommended to install the excellent RStudio, and test-run R based on an introductory user guides:

- RStudio, the recommended R Integrated Development Envrionment (IDE), available free of charge for Windows, Mac and Linux from [http://www.rstudio.com/](http://www.rstudio.com/)

- Torfs, P. and Brauer, C., 2012. A (very) short Introduction to R Torfs, P. and Brauer. [Comprehensive R Archive Network](http://cran.r-project.org/doc/contrib/Torfs+Brauer-Short-R-Intro.pdf)

# A couple of practical applications

- Tomintz, M. N., Clarke, G. P., & Rigby, J. E. (2008). The geography of smoking in Leeds: estimating individual smoking rates and the implications for the location of stop smoking services. Area, 40(3), 341-353.

- Lovelace, R., Ballas, D., & Watson, M. (2013). A spatial microsimulation approach for the analysis of commuter patterns: from individual to regional levels. Journal of Transport Geography.

# Methodology

- Deming, W. E., & Stephan, F. F. (1940). On a least squares adjustment of a sampled frequency table when the expected marginal totals are known. The Annals of Mathematical Statistics, 11(4), 427-444.

- Fienberg, S. E. (1970). An iterative procedure for estimation in contingency tables. The Annals of Mathematical Statistics, 907-917.
