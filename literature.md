# Background reading

These references are available for free online. It is recommended that
course participants acquaint themselves with the basics of spatial microsimulation before the course:

# R

To get to grips with R, users are recommended to install the excellent RStudio, and test-run R based on an introductory user guides:

RStudio, the recommended R Integrated Development Envrionment (IDE), available free of charge for Windows, Mac and Linux from http://www.rstudio.com/

Torfs, P. and Brauer, C., 2012. A (very) short Introduction to R Torfs, P. and Brauer. http://cran.r-project.org/doc/contrib/Torfs+Brauer-Short-R-Intro.pdf
