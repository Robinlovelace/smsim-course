	<strong><span>"An edupunk is someone who doesn't want to play by the old college rules.</span> </strong>Maybe you have interests that don't fit the academic mold. Maybe you're in a remote location. Maybe you have a family, a job, or other responsibilities and you can't take on life as a full-time student. Maybe you love new technology and new ways of learning. Or maybe you're just a rebel!"</p>
<p>
	Either way, there's tremendous value in pursuing an education or career on your own.Â </p>
<p>
	This challenge is based on the advice and wisdom laid out in Anya Kamenetz' book: <a href="http://edupunksguide.org/" target="_blank">The Edupunk's Guide to a DIY Credential</a>.</p>
